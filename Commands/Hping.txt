1) #hping3 -1 192.168.42.10-------------------Sends ICMP ping request to check for the live hosts which is same as ping command [-1 == --icmp]

2) #hping3 -A 192.168.42.10-------------------ACK scan to find live host and open port, we can perform this request when host did not respond to our ping request [-A == --ack]

3) #hping3 -A -p 80 192.168.42.10-------------------ACK scan to find live host and check for open port 80, we can perform this request when host did not respond to ping request [-A == --ack] 

4) #hping3 -2 -p 80 192.168.42.10-----------------UDP packet will send and if no-reply then port is open, if port is closed then it came back with the ICMP error message [-2 == --udp]

5) #hping3 -Q -p 139 192.168.42.10--------------- Collect all the TCP packet sequence numbers generated by the target host [-Q == --seqnum]

6) #hping3 -S -p 80 --tcp-timestamp 192.168.42.10--------Enable the TCP timestamp in packets as many Firewalls deny the packets without TCP timestamp and guess the target uptime [-S == --syn]

7) #hping3 -8 0-140 -V 192.168.42.10----------------Scan the range of ports and -V is used to see live result [-8 == --scan] [-V == --verbose]

8) #hping3 -F -P -U -p 80 192.168.42.10------------Send FIN, PUSH, RST Packet on port number, and if no-reply then port is open, if port is closed it will return RST response [-F == --fin] [-P == --push] [-U == --urg]

9) #hping3 -1 --rand-dest -I eth0 192.168.43.x---------Perform ICMP scan randomly on the entire subnet to check live hosts by sending ICMP echo request within the interface eth0[-I == --interface]

10) hping3 -S --rand-source -p 3306 --flood 192.168.43.10----------------Send unlimited SYN packet from the random source to perform Dos Attack [-S == --syn]
