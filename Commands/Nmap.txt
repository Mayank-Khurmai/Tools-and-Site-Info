1) nmap 192.168.42.0/24------------------------First perform ARP Ping Scan to find live hosts using Nmap to get IP Address, Device Name and MAC Address and then check for all the common open Ports in the entire network subnet

2) nmap -sn 192.168.42.0/24-------------------Only Perform the ARP Ping scan to check for the live hosts and did not check for the open ports

3) nmap -Pn 192.168.42.0/24------------------Directly checks only for the open ports and do not check for the live hosts by pinging the host

4) nmap -sn -PU 192.168.42.0/24--------------Only Check for Live Hosts using the UDP Protocol as UDP have advanatages of detecting the system behind Firewall with strict TCP filtering

5) nmap -PU 192.168.42/24----------------Perform UDP scan to check for the live hosts and open ports

6) nmap -sn -PE 192.168.42.0/24-------------Perform ICMP ping (Ping Sweep) Scan to check for the live hosts in the entire subnet mask as nmap use ARP Ping Scan as default scan

7) nmap -sn -PE 192.168.42.0-255-------------Perform ICMP ping (Ping Sweep) Scan to check for the live hosts in the IP range

8) nmap -sn -PP 192.168.42.0/24-------------Perform ICMP TimeStamp ping scan to check for the live host, as many firewall blocks the packets without timestamp

9) nmap -sn -PM 192.168.42.0/24-------------Perform ICMP Address mask query to check the live host in case if ICMP TimeStamp packets are blocked by the Administrator

10) nmap -sn -PS 192.168.42.0/24-----------Perform TCP SYN Ping Scan to check for the live host, in this attacker send the empty TCP+SYN packet, and then server send ACK packet which mean host is live and then attacker send RST packet to terminate the connection, thus prevent from log creation

11) nmap -sn -PA 192.168.42.0/24-----------Perform TCP ACK Ping Scan, in this attacker send the empty ACK packet to server and server send the RST packet as there is no prior connection, so by getting reply , it means that system is live

12) nmap -sn -PO 192.168.42.0/24-----------Perform IP Protocol Ping Scan by sending ICMP, IGMP, TCP, UDP packets as default and we can configure Nmap to send othes types of protocol packets too in order of hoping that any type of protocol will get accepted and we get response to verify that the host is live

13) nmap -sT 192.168.42.250----------Perform TCP Connect (Full Open) Scan to find the open ports. In this scan 3-way TCP handshake take place and this type of scan can easily be detected and record in the log files

14) nmap -sS 192.168.42.250---------Perform Stealth Scan (Half Open/SYN Scan) to find the open ports. In this attacker send the SYN packets and server sends the SYN+ACK packets and then attacker sends the RST packets to terminate the connection instead of ACK packet to estabished connection and this type of scan helps to bypass Firewall and log generation

15) nmap -sX 192.168.42.250-------This Xmas Scan is a type of Inverse TCP Scanning technique. In this attacker send the TCP packet with all the three FIN, URG, PUSH flags, if port is open then no response, if port is close then RST packet will come and this type of scan will not work for all type of OS. In Xmas, if no flag is set then it is known as NULL Scanning, if only FIN flag is set in Xmas Scan then it is known as FIN scan

16) nmap -sM 192.168.42.250----------In TCP Maimon attack, attacker send the FIN+ACK packet, if the port is open then no response, if the port is close then RST packet will come

17) nmap -sA 192.168.42.250----------ACK Flag Probe Scan will check for the Firewall presence. If all the ports are filtered then firewall is present and if un-filtered then firewall is not present

18) nmap -sI <zombie_ip> <target_ip>------------IPID/IDLE Header Port Scan first take the IP Fragment ID of the Zombie System and then send the packet to victim system in name of Zombie IP ID and then server reply back to the Zombie and then attacker again check for the Increment im the IP ID to verify for the open ports in server

19) nmap -sU 192.168.42.250------------UDP port scan to check for the Open/Close Port, if port is open then no reply, if port is close then ICMP error message will come back

20) nmap -O 192.168.42.250---------Perform the OS Detection Scan

21) nmap -sY 192.168.42.250---------In SCTP INIT Scan attacker send the INIT Chunks to the server and server reply with INIT+ACK Chunk means port is open whereas Abort Chunk reply implies that port is closed and no reply indicate that port is filtered (SCTP is 4-way Handshake process, but this scan use only use half method)

22) nmap -sZ 192.168.42.250---------In SCTP Cookie Echo Scan, attacker send the Cookie Echo Chunk to the target host, if no reply then port is open , if reply with Abort Chunk then port is closed

23) nmap -sL 192.168.42.0/24---------List Scanning print all the IP names without actual pinging the host and Reverse DNS is performed to identify the host name

24) nmap -6 mayankkhurmai.in-----------Use to Scan the IPv6 address of any website , server or host

25) nmap -sV 192.168.42.250-----------Detect the Open Ports with their Survice running and Versions

26) nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse 192.168.42.250--------------OS Detection using the Nmap Script [--script == -sC]

27) nmap -sS -T4 -A -f 192.168.42.250---------------SYN/FIN Scan using the IP Fragmentation to scan the target device beyond the Firewall/IDS

28) nmap --source-port 80 192.168.42.250-----------To Bypass the Firewall/IDS by manipulating the source port number, because many IDS allow packet to receive only form common ports and block the other ports packets [-g == --source-port]

29) nmap -D RND:10 192.168.43.250------------In this Decoy scan, it use the 10 Random IP Address including real IP address to scan the target host so that Victim cannnot clearify that which IP is the real attacker

30) nmap -D 192.168.43.1,192.168.43.2,192.168.43.3 192.168.43.250---------Decoy Scan using our own manual Decoy IP address list to scan the target host with manually specified IP address

31) nmap 192.168.43.250 --data 0xdeadbeef--------------Crafting Packet by appending Binary String in Hexadecimal format in order to scan beyond IDS/Firewall

32) nmap 192.168.43.250 --data-string "mayank"--------------Crafting Packet by appending String in order to scan beyond IDS/Firewall

33) nmap 192.168.43.250 --data-string 5--------------Crafting Packet by appending String of random length 5 in order to scan beaond IDS/Firewall

34) nmap --randomize-hosts 192.168.43.250-------------To scan the target host by using any randomize host

35) nmap --badsum 192.168.43.250------------Attacker send the Bad TCP/UDP Checksum to the target to check for the bypass of IDS/Firewall
