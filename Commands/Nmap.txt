1) nmap 192.168.42.0/24------------------------First perform ARP Ping Scan to find live hosts using Nmap to get IP Address, Device Name and MAC Address and then check for all the common open Ports in the entire network subnet

2) nmap -sn 192.168.42.0/24-------------------Only Perform the ARP Ping scan to check for the live hosts and did not check for the open ports

3) nmap -Pn 192.168.42.0/24------------------Directly checks only for the open ports and do not check for the live hosts by pinging the host

4) nmap -sn -PU 192.168.42.0/24--------------Only Check for Live Hosts using the UDP Protocol as UDP have advanatages of detecting the system behind Firewall with strict TCP filtering

5) nmap -PU 192.168.42/24----------------Perform UDP scan to check for the live hosts and open hosts

6) nmap -sn -PE 192.168.42.0/24-------------Perform ICMP ping (Ping Sweep) Scan to check for the live hosts in the entire subnet mask as nmap use ARP Ping Scan as default scan

7) nmap -sn -PE 192.168.42.0-255-------------Perform ICMP ping (Ping Sweep) Scan to check for the live hosts in the IP range

8) nmap -sn -PP 192.168.42.0/24-------------Perform ICMP TimeStamp ping scan to check for the live host, as many firewall blocks the packets without timestamp

9) nmap -sn -PM 192.168.42.0/24-------------Perform ICMP Address mask query to check the live host in case if ICMP TimeStamp packets are blocked by the Administrator\

10) nmap -sn -PS 192.168.42.0/24-----------Perform TCP SYN Ping Scan to check for the live host, in this attacker send the empty TCP+SYN packet, and then server send ACK packet which mean host is live and then attacker send RST packet to terminate the connection, thus prevent from log creation

11) nmap -sn -PA 192.168.42.0/24-----------Perform TCP ACK Ping Scan, in this attacker send the empty ACK packet to server and server send the RST packet as there is no prior connection, so by getting reply , it means that system is live

12) nmap -sn -PO 192.168.42.0/24-----------Perform IP Protocol Ping Scan by sending ICMP, IGMP, TCP, UDP packets as default and we can configure Nmap to send othes types of protocol packets too in order of hoping that any type of protocol will get accepted and we get response to verify that the host is live

13) nmap -sT 192.168.42.250----------Perform TCP Connect (Full Open) Scan to find the open ports. In this scan 3-way TCP handshake take place and this type of scan can easily be detected and record in the log files

14) nmap -sS 192.168.42.250---------Perform Stealth Scan (Half Open/SYN Scan) to find the open ports. In this attacker send the SYN packets and server sends the SYN+ACK packets and then attacker sends the RST packets to terminate the connection instead of ACK packet to estabished connection
