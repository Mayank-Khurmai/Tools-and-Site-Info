1) nmap 192.168.42.0/24------------------------First perform ARP Ping Scan to find live hosts using Nmap to get IP Address, Device Name and MAC Address and then check for all the common open Ports in the entire network subnet

2) nmap -sn 192.168.42.0/24-------------------Only Perform the ARP Ping scan to check for the live hosts and did not check for the open ports

3) nmap -Pn 192.168.42.0/24------------------Directly checks only for the open ports and do not check for the live hosts by pinging the host

4) nmap -sn -PU 192.168.42.0/24--------------Only Check for Live Hosts using the UDP Protocol as UDP have advanatages of detecting the system behind Firewall with strict TCP filtering

5) nmap -PU 192.168.42/24----------------Perform UDP scan to check for the live hosts and open hosts

6) nmap -sn -PE 192.168.42.0/24-------------Perform ICMP ping (Ping Sweep) Scan to check for the live hosts in the entire subnet mask as nmap use ARP Ping Scan as default scan

7) nmap -sn -PE 192.168.42.0-255-------------Perform ICMP ping (Ping Sweep) Scan to check for the live hosts in the IP range

8) nmap -sn -PP 192.168.42.0/24-------------Perform ICMP TimeStamp ping scan to check for the live host, as many firewall blocks the packets without timestamp

9) nmap -sn -PM 192.168.42.0/24-------------Perform ICMP Address mask query to check the live host in case if ICMP TimeStamp packets are blocked by the Administrator\
